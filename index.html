        <p>Visual Studio Code is an integrated development environment made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS.[9] Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git. Users can change the theme, keyboard shortcuts, preferences, and install extensions that add additional functionality.

            Microsoft has released most of Visual Studio Code's source code on GitHub under the permissive MIT License,[5][10] while the releases by Microsoft are proprietary freeware.[7]
            
            In the Stack Overflow 2021 Developer Survey, Visual Studio Code was ranked the most popular developer environment tool, with 70% of 82,000 respondents reporting that they use it.[11]
            
            Visual Studio Code was first announced on April 29, 2015, by Microsoft at the 2015 Build conference. A preview build was released shortly thereafter.[12]
